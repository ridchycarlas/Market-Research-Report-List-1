<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The D type Doppler Diagnostic Ultrasound Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CW</li><li>PW</li></ul></p>
<p><p>D type Doppler Diagnostic Ultrasound Devices encompass Continuous Wave (CW) and Pulsed Wave (PW) technologies. CW devices use a continuous signal to measure high-velocity blood flow without depth resolution, making them ideal for assessing conditions like valvular heart disease. PW devices, on the other hand, emit short pulses, allowing for depth-specific measurements and enabling the evaluation of both high and low-velocity flows. Together, these technologies facilitate comprehensive cardiovascular assessments, aiding in accurate diagnoses and treatment planning.</p></p>
